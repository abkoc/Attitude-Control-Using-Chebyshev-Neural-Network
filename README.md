Re-Implementation of paper "Active attitude fault-tolerant tracking control of flexible spacecraft via the Chebyshev neural Network"

Re-implemented paper: Lu, K., Li, T., & Zhang, L. (2019). Active attitude fault-tolerant tracking control of flexible spacecraft via the Chebyshev neural network. Transactions of the Institute of Measurement and Control, 41(4), 925â€“933. https://doi.org/10.1177/0142331218803410

To get results;
1) run "Reading_Project_script.m" to create .mat file.
2) initialize "Reading_Project_model.slx" with created .mat file.
3) simulate "Reading_Project_model.slx" for 500 seconds.
